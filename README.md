# Robot-Vision-based-Navigation-and-Obstacle-Avoidance-
Completed with partner Aidan Anderson for the USF Course Control of Mobile Robotics. Contains python scripts used to make the provided Raspberry Pi Robot perform tasks involving vision-based navigation and obstacle avoidance using a camera. faceGoal's script makes the robot orient itself towards the goal of the selected color (pink, green, or blue), and will continue orienting itself if the object is moved. motionToGoal makes the robot orient itself towards the goal of the selected color (pink, green, or blue) and move towards it with error adjustment. triangulation.py uses user-inputted information about the positions of the pink, green, and blue goals to determine the location of the robot relative to the three objects. The robot rotates itself towards the goals to gather the needed data. bugAlgorithm.py makes the robot orient itself towards and travel to the goal of the selected color (pink, green, or blue). This script will use the Bug 0 algorithm when the robot encounters an obstacle, making it follow the wall of the obstacle until it has a clear path to the goal.
